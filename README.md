## Preface

This is a pirate-themed tutorial for building an OHM fork on Stellar, not because anyone should actually build one, their mechanisms are pretty unsustainable. but because OHM uses a fair amount of useful DeFi concepts that can be applied to other, more valuable applications. I also just thought coding one would be fun :)

## Intro

Ahoy Maty! So you be wantin' ta build a crew of scalleywags to journey the high seas with, huntin for the best booty of em all SHELLS. Well that suits me - could always do with a couple more sea dogs on the open ocean.
